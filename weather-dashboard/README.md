# Capstone-Project
This repository contains my capstone project for a Weather Dashboard.

## Description
The Weather Dashboard will provide users with easy-to-access weather information, including current conditions, upto 5 days forecasts for any city, and geolocation support. With the OpenWeatherMap API, I can deliver high-quality data while providing an enjoyable user experience. The project will challenge my skills in React JS, Tailwind CSS, API integration, and UI design.

## Features
- Search by City or current location: Users can search for the weather of any city.
- Current Weather: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility,            precipitation and weather conditions.
-Dark and Light mode toggle depending on weather conditions in searched city.
- 5-Day Forecast: Shows a 5-day weather forecast with daily temperature summaries.
- Responsive Design: The dashboard is designed to be visually appealing and responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Technologies Used
- React js: For building the user interface.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout.
- OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching data.


## Setup
- Clone this repository.
- Install vite and its dependencies.
- Set up API keys and test basic API calls to ensure data is being retrieved.
